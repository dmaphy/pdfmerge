# About

`pdfmerge4unix` has been written in 2003 by Didier F.B Casse
[`<mailto:didier@microtronyx.com>`](mailto:didier@microtronyx.com).
In 2010 it seemed pretty discontinued, so Dominic Hopf resumed this work to fix
some issues reported to the Fedora package of `pdfmerge` in the meanwhile.


# Usage

The usage of this small but nice tool is pretty easy. Place all your files in
one directory, change to that directory and run something like

> `pdfmerge file1.pdf file2.pdf ... fileN.pdf outfile.pdf`

You can even mention PDF files in subdirectories like this:

> `pdfmerge subdir1/file1.pdf subdir2/file2.pdf ... outfile.pdf`

And last but not least you can access a directory from a higher level:

> `pdfmerge file1.pdf ../file2.pdf ... outfile.pdf`
